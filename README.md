# 8fold Markup

When it comes to semi-sctructured data, XML and derivitives can be very tedious and heavy on syntax. 8fold Markup seeks to make writing it easier and allow for more dynamism.

Markup also minifies the results of what you create, making it a smaller and faster package sent over the wire.

Markup uses one I/O step to compile the resulting plain text, which means there is no parsing of strings to arrive at the desired output.

When it comes to HTML attributes will be consistently ordered and, if a given attribute is not a part of the W3C HTML5 specification or is deprecated for that element, it will automatically be removed; keeping your markup up to date without having to rewrite a bunch of HTML templates.
